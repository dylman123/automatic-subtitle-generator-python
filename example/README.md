## Input video
A video is required to run the demo. The following file formats are supported:
- *.m4v
- *.mp4"
- *.mov"

For example, the video clip `input.m4v` was used as an input:
![Input Video](thumbnail.png)

## Captions CSV
A CSV file is generated automatically so that the user can edit captions after the Speech-To-Text transcription took place. Once edited, the CSV file is then converted into a FCPXML file.

For example, the file `captions.csv` was generated.

## Output FCPXML
The outputted file is of the format .fcpxml and is readable by Final Cut Pro X. This allows the user to edit the auto-generated captions before the video is to be rendered.

For example, the file `output.fcpxml` was outputted.
